### Docker Build & Deployment

You can use Docker to build and deploy both the client and server containers.

1. **Building Docker Images:**

   - **Client:**
     Navigate to the `client` directory and run:
     ```bash
     docker build -t spacey-client .
     ```
     The Dockerfile in the client folder uses the Node LTS image, installs dependencies, copies the source code, sets the appropriate permissions, and exposes the desired port (typically 3000 for development, configurable for production).

   - **Server:**
     Navigate to the `server` directory and run:
     ```bash
     docker build -t spacey-server .
     ```
     The server Dockerfile installs dependencies, copies the source code, and runs the application using nodemon for auto-reloading in development mode.

2. **Using Docker Compose:**

   If a `docker-compose.yml` file is provided, you can streamline the process:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   This command builds and runs both the client and server containers as defined in the compose file.

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

1. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the Client:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
   The client will be running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and the server on [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

#### Using Docker
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## JWT, Cookies, and Login Management

This section details the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), cookie-based session management, and the overall login flow used in the application.

### JWT Generation & Validation
- **Token Creation:**  
  After successful login, the server generates a JWT using a secret key (configured via the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable). The token payload includes essential user information (such as user ID and role) and an expiration time.

- **Token Validation:**  
  For each incoming request, middleware verifies the presence and validity of the JWT (typically stored in an HTTP-only cookie). This ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes.

- **Token Expiry & Refresh:**  
  JWTs are configured to expire after a set duration to enhance security. A refresh mechanism, using a secondary secret (`REFRESH_SECRET`), allows for new tokens to be issued without requiring the user to log in again, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Cookie-Based Session Management
- **HTTP-only Cookies:**  
  JWTs are stored in HTTP-only cookies, which are inaccessible via JavaScript, reducing the risk of XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
  
- **Secure Cookie Attributes:**  
  Cookies are set with Secure and SameSite attributes in production environments to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks and enhance overall security.

- **Server-Side Handling:**  
  Authentication middleware extracts JWTs from cookies, validates them, and attaches the corresponding user information to the request object for further processing by protected routes.

### Login & Logout Flow
- **Login Flow:**  
  1. User submits credentials via the login form.
  2. The server validates credentials (comparing with securely hashed passwords).
  3. Upon successful authentication, a JWT is generated and sent in an HTTP-only cookie.
  4. The user is redirected to a secure area (e.g., dashboard).

- **Logout Flow:**  
  1. User initiates logout.
  2. The server clears the authentication cookie, effectively terminating the session.
  3. Subsequent requests will require re-authentication.

### Error Handling & Security Enhancements
- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Login routes are protected with rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  Failed login attempts and other suspicious activities are logged for security review.
- **Middleware Integration:**  
  Centralized authentication middleware (e.g., in `authMiddlewares.js`) ensures consistent token validation and error handling across all routes.

All these techniques work together to provide a secure, scalable, and user-friendly approach to managing authentication and sessions in the SpaceY application.
